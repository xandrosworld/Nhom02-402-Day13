# Day 13 Observability Lab Template

Template repo for a 4-hour hands-on lab on Monitoring, Logging, and Observability.

## What students will build

A small FastAPI "agent" instrumented with:
- structured JSON logging
- correlation ID propagation
- PII scrubbing
- Langfuse tracing
- minimal metrics aggregation
- SLOs, alerts, and a blueprint report

This template is intentionally incomplete. Teams are expected to finish TODOs during the lab.

## Team workflow

Use [TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md](c:/Users/DELL/Desktop/test/day13/TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md) as the source of truth for file ownership, branch naming, and deliverables before the team starts coding.

## Suggested lab flow (Gapped Template)

1. **Run the starter app**: Observe that logs are basic and correlation IDs are missing.
2. **Implement Correlation IDs**: Fix `app/middleware.py` so every request has a unique `x-request-id`.
3. **Enrich Logs**: Update `app/main.py` to bind user, session, and feature context to every log.
4. **Sanitize Data**: Implement the PII scrubber in `app/logging_config.py`.
5. **Verify with Script**: Run `python scripts/validate_logs.py` to check your progress.
6. **Tracing**: Send 10-20 requests and verify traces in Langfuse (ensure `observe` decorator is used).
7. **Dashboards**: Build your 6-panel dashboard from exported metrics.
8. **Alerting**: Configure alert rules in `config/alert_rules.yaml` and test them.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Tooling

```bash
# Generate requests (use --concurrency 5 to test parallel bottlenecks)
python scripts/load_test.py --concurrency 5

# Inject failures live
python scripts/inject_incident.py --scenario rag_slow

# Check your implementation progress
python scripts/validate_logs.py
```

## Team role suggestion

- Member A: logging + PII
- Member B: tracing + tags
- Member C: SLO + alerts
- Member D: load test + incident injection
- Member E: dashboard + evidence
- Member F: blueprint + demo lead

## Grading policy (60/40 Split)

Your final grade is calculated as follows:

1. **Group Score (60%)**: 
   - **Technical Implementation (30 pts)**: Verified by `validate_logs.py` and live system state.
   - **Incident Response (10 pts)**: Accuracy of your root cause analysis in the report.
   - **Live Demo (20 pts)**: Team presentation and system demonstration.
2. **Individual Score (40%)**:
   - **Individual Report (20 pts)**: Quality of your specific contributions in `docs/blueprint-template.md`.
   - **Git Evidence (20 pts)**: Traceable work via commits and code ownership.

**Passing Criteria**: 
- All `TODO` blocks must be completed.
- Minimum of 10 traces must be visible in Langfuse.
- Dashboard must show all 6 required panels.
